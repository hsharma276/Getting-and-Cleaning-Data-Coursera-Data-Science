#Getting and Cleaning Data
#Objective of the project
#Write R script called run_analysis.R to perform following steps:
#1. Create a larger data set merging training and the test sets .
#2. Fetch measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#3. Create descriptive activity names for the dataset.
#4. Creates a new, tidy data set having average of each variable for each activity and subject.
Steps:
#1.Download the data source and put folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in some of the folder in your local computer.
#2.Put the "run_analysis.R" in one folder above the data folder given above and set the working directory to the directory where R script #"run_analysis.R" is placed.
#3.Run "source("run_analysis.R")" command. it will load some libraries and after some time will create a new file "tiny_data.txt" in the #same directroy where R script is placed.
